## Objectives 

Students will start their first portfolio project, building a personal, brochure style website.

### Key Student Take-Aways

* Students should be applying all that theyâ€™ve learned so far to set up a static personal site
* The website can act as a place for students to showcase their work as they make more projects long after the class is over.  Having a personal website to display work is great for potential employers and clients to see what you are capable of
* Building a fully functional website that looks good on any device takes time and involves a series of steps from planning and designing all the way to styling and publishing


### Teacher Note

It is likely that not all students will complete this project during class, so they should continue to work on it.  Even after they finish up, they can use this site as a foundation and continue to work on it as they get better and more experienced in web development.

### Caveats:

If students want to host their website and/or buy a custom domain for themselves, they must be aware that these services typically cost money and are not provided by Flatiron.
